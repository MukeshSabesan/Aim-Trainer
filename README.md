# Aim-Trainer

An aim trainer created using Python and PyGame. It takes inspiration from aimtrainer.io but the actual gameplay is more like AimLab. Created with three difficulty levels which vary the size of the targets. There is a time limit of 90 seconds. This is the fullscreen version. The reason why I don't put merge this with the main is because of some issues with the full screen. This will be fixed soon.
